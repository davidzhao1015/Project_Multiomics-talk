TI  - The Urinary Metabolome of Healthy Newborns.
LID - 10.3390/metabo10040165 [doi]

AB  - The knowledge of normal metabolite values for neonates is key to establishing 
      robust cut-off values to diagnose diseases, to predict the occurrence of new 
      diseases, to monitor a neonate's metabolism, or to assess their general health 
      status. For full term-newborns, many reference biochemical values are available 
      for blood, serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. However, there is a surprising 
      lack of information about normal urine concentration values for a large number of 
      important metabolites in neonates. In the present work, we used targeted tandem 
      mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based metabolomic assays to identify and quantify 136 
      metabolites of biomedical interest in the urine from 48 healthy, full-term term 
      neonates, collected in the first 24 h of life. In addition to this experimental 
      study, we performed a literature review (covering the past eight years and over 
      500 papers) to update the references values in the Human Metabolome 
      Database/Urine Metabolome Database (HMDB/UMDB). Notably, 86 of the experimentally 
      measured urinary metabolites are being reported in neonates/infants for the first 
      time and another 20 metabolites are being reported in human urine for the first 
      time ever. Sex differences were found for 15 metabolites. The literature review 
      allowed us to identify another 78 urinary metabolites with concentration data. As 
      a result, reference concentration values and ranges for 378 neonatal urinary 
      metabolites are now publicly accessible via the HMDB.

AB  - Cancer survivors experience numerous treatment side effects that negatively 
      affect their quality of life. Cognitive side effects are especially insidious, as 
      they affect memory, cognition, and learning. Neurocognitive deficits occur prior 
      to cancer treatment, arising even before cancer diagnosis, and we refer to them 
      as "tumor brain." Metabolomics is a new area of research that focuses on 
      metabolome profiles and provides important mechanistic insights into various 
      human diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging. Many 
      neurological diseases and conditions affect metabolic processes in the brain. 
      However, the tumor brain metabolome has never been analyzed. In our study we used 
      direct flow injection/mass spectrometry (DI-MS) analysis to establish the effects 
      of the growth of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and sarcoma on the brain 
      metabolome of TumorGraft™ mice. We found that the growth of malignant non-CNS 
      tumors impacted metabolic processes in the brain, affecting protein biosynthesis, 
      and amino acid and sphingolipid metabolism. The observed metabolic changes were 
      similar to those reported for neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging, and may 
      have potential mechanistic value for future analysis of the tumor brain 
      phenomenon.

TI  - Urinary metabolomics to develop predictors for pediatric acute kidney injury.
PG  - 2079-2090
LID - 10.1007/s00467-021-05380-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is characterized by an abrupt decline in 
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We sought to identify separate early urinary 
      metabolomic signatures at AKI onset (with-AKI) and prior to onset of functional 
      impairment (pre-AKI). METHODS: Pre-AKI (n=15), AKI (n=22), and respective 
      controls (n=30) from two prospective PICU cohort studies provided urine samples 
      which were analyzed by GC-MS and DI-MS mass spectrometry (193 metabolites). The 
      cohort (n=58) was 8.7±6.4 years old and 66% male. AKI patients had longer PICU 
      stays, higher PRISM scores, vasopressors requirement, and respiratory diagnosis 
      and less commonly had trauma or post-operative diagnosis. Urine was collected 
      within 2-3 days after admission and daily until day 5 or 14. RESULTS: The 
      metabolite classifiers for pre-AKI samples (1.5±1.1 days prior to AKI onset) had 
      a cross-validated area under receiver operator curve (AUC)=0.93 (95%CI 0.85-1.0); 
      with-AKI samples had an AUC=0.94 (95%CI 0.87-1.0). A parsimonious pre-AKI 
      classifier with 13 metabolites was similarly robust (AUC=0.96, 95%CI 0.89-1.0). 
      Both classifiers were similar and showed modest correlation of high-ranking 
      metabolites (tau=0.47, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This exploratory study demonstrates 
      the potential of a urine metabolite classifier to detect AKI-risk in pediatric 
      populations earlier than the current standard of diagnosis with the need for 
      external validation. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is 
      available as Supplementary information with inner reference to ESM for GA.

AB  - Research exploring the development and outcome of COVID-19 infections has led to 
      the need to find better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This 
      cross-sectional study used targeted metabolomics to identify potential COVID-19 
      biomarkers that predicted the course of the illness by assessing 110 endogenous 
      plasma metabolites from individuals admitted to a local hospital for 
      diagnosis/treatment. Patients were classified into four groups (≈ 40 each) 
      according to standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 testing and 
      disease course: PCR-/controls (i.e., non-COVID controls), PCR+/not-hospitalized, 
      PCR+/hospitalized, and PCR+/intubated. Blood samples were collected within 2 days 
      of admission/PCR testing. Metabolite concentration data, demographic data and 
      clinical data were used to propose biomarkers and develop optimal regression 
      models for the diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19. The area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI) was used to assess each models' 
      predictive value. A panel that included the kynurenine: tryptophan ratio, lysoPC 
      a C26:0, and pyruvic acid discriminated non-COVID controls from 
      PCR+/not-hospitalized (AUC = 0.947; 95% CI 0.931-0.962). A second panel 
      consisting of C10:2, butyric acid, and pyruvic acid distinguished 
      PCR+/not-hospitalized from PCR+/hospitalized and PCR+/intubated (AUC = 0.975; 95% 
      CI 0.968-0.983). Only lysoPC a C28:0 differentiated PCR+/hospitalized from 
      PCR+/intubated patients (AUC = 0.770; 95% CI 0.736-0.803). If additional studies 
      with targeted metabolomics confirm the diagnostic value of these plasma 
      biomarkers, such panels could eventually be of clinical use in medical practice.

      metabolomics for early noninvasive detection of AMR in pediatric kidney 
      transplant recipients. METHODS: Urine samples (n = 396) from a prospective, 
      observational cohort of 59 renal transplant patients with surveillance or 
      indication biopsies were assayed for 133 unique metabolites by quantitative mass 
      spectrometry. Samples were classified according to Banff criteria for AMR and 
      partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to identify associated 
      changes in metabolite patterns by creating a composite index based on all 133 
      metabolites. RESULTS: Urine samples of patients with (n = 40) and without AMR (n 
      = 278) were analyzed and a classifier for AMR was identified (area under receiver 
      operating characteristic curve = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.91; P = 
      0.006). Application of the classifier to "indeterminate" samples (samples that 
      partially fulfilled Banff criteria for AMR; n = 65) yielded an AMR score of 0.19 
      ± 0.15, intermediate between scores for AMR and No AMR (0.28 ± 0.14 and 0.10 ± 
      0.13 respectively, P ≤ 0.001). The AMR score was associated with the presence of 
      donor-specific antibodies, biopsy indication, Banff ct, t, ah and cg scores, and 
      retained accuracy when applied to subclinical cases (creatinine, <25% increase 
      from baseline) or had minimal or no transplant glomerulopathy (Banff cg0-1). 
      Exploratory classifiers that segregated samples based on concurrent T 
      cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) identified overlapping metabolite signatures 
      between AMR and TCMR, suggesting similar pathophysiology of tissue injury. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings identify a urine metabolic classifier for 
      AMR. Independent validation is needed to verify its utility for accurate, 
      noninvasive AMR detection.

AB  - Viral sepsis has been proposed as an accurate term to describe all multisystemic 
      dysregulations and clinical findings in severe and critically ill COVID-19 
      patients. The adoption of this term may help the implementation of more accurate 
      strategies of early diagnosis, prognosis, and in-hospital treatment. We 
      accurately quantified 110 metabolites using targeted metabolomics, and 13 
      cytokines/chemokines in plasma samples of 121 COVID-19 patients with different 
      levels of severity, and 37 non-COVID-19 individuals. Analyses revealed an 
      integrated host-dependent dysregulation of inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil 
      activation chemokines, glycolysis, mitochondrial metabolism, amino acid 
      metabolism, polyamine synthesis, and lipid metabolism typical of sepsis processes 
      distinctive of a mild disease. Dysregulated metabolites and cytokines/chemokines 
      showed differential correlation patterns in mild and critically ill patients, 
      indicating a crosstalk between metabolism and hyperinflammation. Using 
      multivariate analysis, powerful models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 
      induced sepsis were generated, as well as for mortality prediction among septic 
      patients. A metabolite panel made of kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, IL-6, LysoPC a 
      C18:2, and phenylalanine discriminated non-COVID-19 from sepsis patients with an 
      area under the curve (AUC (95%CI)) of 0.991 (0.986-0.995), with sensitivity of 
      0.978 (0.963-0.992) and specificity of 0.920 (0.890-0.949). The panel that 
      included C10:2, IL-6, NLR, and C5 discriminated mild patients from sepsis 
      patients with an AUC (95%CI) of 0.965 (0.952-0.977), with sensitivity of 
      0.993(0.984-1.000) and specificity of 0.851 (0.815-0.887). The panel with citric 
      acid, LysoPC a C28:1, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and kynurenine/tryptophan 
      ratio discriminated severe patients from sepsis patients with an AUC (95%CI) of 
      0.829 (0.800-0.858), with sensitivity of 0.738 (0.695-0.781) and specificity of 
      0.781 (0.735-0.827). Septic patients who survived were different from those that 
      did not survive with a model consisting of hippuric acid, along with the presence 
      of Type II diabetes, with an AUC (95%CI) of 0.831 (0.788-0.874), with sensitivity 
      of 0.765 (0.697-0.832) and specificity of 0.817 (0.770-0.865).

TI  - ClassyFire: automated chemical classification with a comprehensive, computable 
      taxonomy.
PG  - 61
LID - 61
AB  - BACKGROUND: Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, 
      classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to 
      biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry 
      still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at 
      chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to 
      either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is 
      regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could 
      not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage 
      between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical 
      classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its 
      druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the 
      sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical 
      structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near 
      impossible. RESULTS: We have developed a comprehensive, flexible, and computable, 
      purely structure-based chemical taxonomy (ChemOnt), along with a computer program 
      (ClassyFire) that uses only chemical structures and structural features to 
      automatically assign all known chemical compounds to a taxonomy consisting of 
      >4800 different categories. This new chemical taxonomy consists of up to 11 
      different levels (Kingdom, SuperClass, Class, SubClass, etc.) with each of the 
      categories defined by unambiguous, computable structural rules. Furthermore each 
      category is named using a consensus-based nomenclature and described (in English) 
      based on the characteristic common structural properties of the compounds it 
      contains. The ClassyFire webserver is freely accessible at 
      http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/. Moreover, a Ruby API version is available at 
      https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/classyfire_api, which provides programmatic 
      access to the ClassyFire server and database. ClassyFire has been used to 
      annotate over 77 million compounds and has already been integrated into other 
      software packages to automatically generate textual descriptions for, and/or 
      infer biological properties of over 100,000 compounds. Additional examples and 
      applications are provided in this paper. CONCLUSION: ClassyFire, in combination 
      with ChemOnt (ClassyFire's comprehensive chemical taxonomy), now allows chemists 
      and cheminformaticians to perform large-scale, rapid and automated chemical 
      classification. Moreover, a freely accessible API allows easy access to more than 
      77 million "ClassyFire" classified compounds. The results can be used to help 
      annotate well studied, as well as lesser-known compounds. In addition, these 
      chemical classifications can be used as input for data integration, and many 
      other cheminformatics-related tasks.

TI  - Non-invasive staging of chronic kidney allograft damage using urine metabolomic 
      profiling.
PG  - e13226
LID - 10.1111/petr.13226 [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney allograft damage is characterized by IFTA and GS. We sought to 
      identify urinary metabolite signatures associated with severity of IFTA and GS in 
      pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Urine samples (n = 396) from 60 pediatric 
      transplant recipients were obtained at the time of kidney biopsy and assayed for 
      133 metabolites by mass spectrometry. Metabolite profiles were quantified via 
      PLS-DA. We used mixed-effects regression to identify laboratory and clinical 
      predictors of histopathology. Urine samples (n = 174) without rejection or AKI 
      were divided into training/validation sets (75:25%). Metabolite classifiers 
      trained on IFTA severity and %GS showed strong statistical correlation (r = .73, 
      P < .001 and r = .72; P < .001, respectively) and remained significant on the 
      validation sets. Regression analysis identified additional clinical features that 
      improved prediction: months post-transplant (GS, IFTA); and proteinuria, GFR, and 
      age (GS only). Addition of clinical variables improved performance of the %GS 
      classifier (AUC = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.85-0.96) but not for IFTA (AUC = 0.82; 95% 
      CI = 0.71-0.92). Despite the presence of potentially confounding phenotypes, 
      these findings were further validated in samples withheld for rejection or AKI. 
      We identify urine metabolite classifiers for IFTA and GS, which may prove useful 
      for non-invasive assessment of histopathological damage.

AB  - The post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), also known as long COVID, is often 
      associated with debilitating symptoms and adverse multisystem consequences. We 
      obtain plasma samples from 117 individuals during and 6 months following their 
      acute phase of infection to comprehensively profile and assess changes in 
      cytokines, proteome, and metabolome. Network analysis reveals sustained 
      inflammatory response, platelet degranulation, and cellular activation during 
      convalescence accompanied by dysregulation in arginine biosynthesis, methionine 
      metabolism, taurine metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle processes. 
      Furthermore, we develop a prognostic model composed of 20 molecules involved in 
      regulating T cell exhaustion and energy metabolism that can reliably predict 
      adverse clinical outcomes following discharge from acute infection with 83% 
      accuracy and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96. Our study reveals pertinent 
      biological processes during convalescence that differ from acute infection, and 
      it supports the development of specific therapies and biomarkers for patients 
      suffering from long COVID.

TI  - Non-invasive differentiation of non-rejection kidney injury from acute rejection 
      in pediatric renal transplant recipients.
PG  - e13364
LID - 10.1111/petr.13364 [doi]
AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major concern in pediatric kidney transplant 
      recipients, where non-alloimmune causes must be distinguished from rejection. We 
      sought to identify a urinary metabolite signature associated with non-rejection 
      kidney injury (NRKI) in pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Urine samples 
      (n = 396) from 60 pediatric transplant participants were obtained at time of 
      kidney biopsy and quantitatively assayed for 133 metabolites by mass 
      spectrometry. Metabolite profiles were analyzed via projection on latent 
      structures discriminant analysis. Mixed-effects regression identified laboratory 
      and clinical predictors of NRKI and distinguished NRKI from T cell-mediated 
      rejection (CMR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and mixed CMR/AMR. Urine 
      samples (n = 199) without rejection were split into NRKI (n = 26; ΔSCr ≥25%), 
      pre-NRKI (n = 35; ΔSCr ≥10% and <25%), and no NRKI (n = 138; ΔSCr <10%) groups. 
      The NRKI discriminant score (dscore) distinguished between NRKI and no NRKI 
      (AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.79-0.94), confirmed by leave-one-out cross-validation 
      (AUC = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.68-0.89). The NRKI dscore also distinguished between NRKI 
      and pre-NRKI (AUC = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.71-0.93). In a linear mixed-effects 
      regression model to account for repeated measures, the NRKI dscore was 
      independent of concurrent rejection, but there was a non-statistical trend for 
      higher dscores with rejection severity. A second exploratory classifier developed 
      to distinguish NRKI from clinical rejection had similar test characteristics 
      (AUC = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.70-0.92, confirmed by LOOCV). This study demonstrates the 
      potential of a urine metabolite classifier to detect NRKI in pediatric kidney 
      transplant patients and non-invasively discriminate NRKI from rejection.

TI  - Validity and utility of urinary CXCL10/Cr immune monitoring in pediatric kidney 
      transplant recipients.
PG  - 1545-1555
LID - 10.1111/ajt.16336 [doi]
AB  - Individualized posttransplant immunosuppression is hampered by suboptimal 
      monitoring strategies. To validate the utility of urinary CXCL10/Cr immune 
      monitoring in children, we conducted a multicenter prospective observational 
      study in children <21 years with serial and biopsy-associated urine samples 
      (n = 97). Biopsies (n = 240) were categorized as normal (NOR), rejection (>i1t1; 
      REJ), indeterminate (IND), BKV infection, and leukocyturia (LEU). An independent 
      pediatric cohort of 180 urines was used for external validation. Ninety-seven 
      patients aged 11.4 ± 5.5 years showed elevated urinary CXCL10/Cr in REJ (3.1, IQR 
      1.1, 16.4; P < .001) and BKV nephropathy (median = 5.6, IQR 1.3, 26.9; P < .001) 
      vs. NOR (0.8, IQR 0.4, 1.5). The AUC for REJ vs. NOR was 0.76 (95% CI 0.66-0.86). 
      Low (0.63) and high (4.08) CXCL10/Cr levels defined high sensitivity and 
      specificity thresholds, respectively; validated against an independent sample set 
      (AUC = 0.76, 95% CI 0.66-0.86). Serial urines anticipated REJ up to 4 weeks prior 
      to biopsy and declined within 1 month following treatment. Elevated mean 
      CXCL10/Cr was correlated with first-year eGFR decline (ρ = -0.37, P ≤ .001), 
      particularly when persistently exceeding ≥4.08 (ratio = 0.81; P < .04). Useful 
      thresholds for urinary CXCL10/Cr levels reproducibly define the risk of 
      rejection, immune quiescence, and decline in allograft function for use in 
      real-time clinical monitoring in children.

TI  - Age and sex determine conversion from immediate-release to extended-release 
      tacrolimus in a multi-center cohort of Canadian pediatric renal transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - e13959
LID - 10.1111/petr.13959 [doi]
AB  - ER-Tac, taken once per day, is associated with improved adherence. This study 
      examined the potential patient and clinical factors that influence clinicians to 
      convert pediatric patients from immediate-release to ER-Tac. This prospective 
      multi-center observational study followed Canadian pediatric kidney transplant 
      recipients up to 5 years post-transplant. Cox Proportional Hazards Regression was 
      used to examine the influence of factors on conversion to ER-Tac. Sixty-six 
      participants were included in this analysis. For every additional year of age at 
      the time of transplant, the likelihood of conversion was more than doubled (HR 
      2.54, CI 1.83, 3.54, P < 0.001). The impact of age reduced by three percent for 
      every month after transplant (HR 0.97, CI 0.95, 0.98, P < 0.001). Girls were more 
      likely to be converted than boys (HR 3.78, CI 1.35, 10.6, P 0.01). Adherence 
      measures (MAM-MM and tacrolimus trough variability), individual barriers to 
      adherence, renal function, HLA mismatch, and rejection were not significant 
      predictors of conversion in the final regression model. ER-Tac was preferentially 
      prescribed to older age and female patients. Female sex and adolescence are both 
      associated with worse graft outcomes, but we found no link between individualized 
      markers of adherence/graft risk and conversion. Clinicians appeared to be using 
      demographic features to distinguish patients at perceived higher risk and 
      converted accordingly, without a case-by-case evaluation of who is more 
      susceptible to poor outcomes.

TI  - Evolution of renal function and urinary biomarker indicators of inflammation on 
      serial kidney biopsies in pediatric kidney transplant recipients with and without 
      rejection.

AB  - Urinary CXCL10 and metabolites are biomarkers independently associated with TCMR. 
      We sought to test whether these biomarkers fluctuate in association with 
      histological severity of TCMR over short time frames. Forty-nine pairs of renal 
      biopsies obtained 1-3 months apart from 40 pediatric renal transplant recipients 
      were each scored for TCMR acuity score (i + t; Banff criteria). Urinary CXCL10:Cr 
      and TCMR MDS were obtained at each biopsy and were tested for association with 
      changes between biopsies in acuity, estimated GFR (ΔeGFR), and 12-month ΔeGFR. 
      Sequential biopsies were obtained 1.8 ± 0.8 months apart. Biopsy 1 was usually 
      obtained under protocol (75%), and 62% percent had evidence of TCMR. Using each 
      biopsy pair for comparison, ΔeGFR did not predict change in acuity. By contrast, 
      change in acuity was significantly correlated with change in urinary CXCL10:Cr (ρ 
      0.45, P = .003) and MDS (ρ 0.29, P = .04) between biopsies. The 12-month ΔeGFR 
      was not predicted by TCMR acuity or CXCL10:Cr at Biopsy 2; however, an inverse 
      correlation was seen with urinary MDS (ρ -0.35; P = .02). Changes in eGFR 
      correlate poorly with evolving TCMR acuity on histology. Urinary biomarkers may 
      be superior for non-invasive monitoring of rejection, including histological 
      response to therapy, and may be prognostic for medium-term function.
